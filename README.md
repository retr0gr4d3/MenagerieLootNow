# MenagerieLootNow [deprecated]
This is a tool made originally by myself, for use of defining required runes on a per-drop basis.
What that means is this tool simply spits out every item you can possibly get from the Chalice. Pick a drop, and the tool will tell you exactly what runes are needed for that drop. Masterwork version soon.


ps this shit dont exist anymore, development terminated, thanks bunghole, guess ill have to just play beyond light now :/
