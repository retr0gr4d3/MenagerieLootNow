# MenagerieLootNow
This is a tool made originally by myself, for use of defining required runes on a per-drop basis.
What that means is this tool simply spits out every item you can possibly get from the Chalice. Pick a drop, and the tool will tell you exactly what runes are needed for that drop. Masterwork version soon.
